				<h1>About artist</h1>
				<h5>-Sresta <span>Bhattarai</span></h5>
				<p>Hi its Sresta here! I am an enthusiastic self-taught artist. Ever since I was a kid I was quite passionate about art. But since the age of 17, I was completely composed on improving my artistic skill. In a short period of time, I was able to improve a lot. I started through scratch and now I am able to sell customized potraits through online, offline and many platforms. Through my art journey, I want to inspire others that even with less of a skill but more of a passion you can really improve your artistic ability by sharing with others and learning by your ownself. Currently 30% of the profit that I gain by selling art goes to animal cares like lifewithfurs and animafoundation.</p>
